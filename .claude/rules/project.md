# Project Overview

**Kora Maps** (`koramaps.app`) — a MapLibre GL map focused on walkability and public transit.

**Branding:**
- Name: "Kora Maps" (brand), "Kora" (short name, e.g. PWA `short_name`). The name is a fantasy word; nearby associations the user welcomes: "core", French *cœur* (heart), Tibetan *kora* (pilgrimage walked on foot).
- Positioning in user-facing copy: "public-transit-first map". Never mention cars ("car-free", "carless" etc.) in outward-facing text — the map is *for* something, not against cars.
- Brand red: `#740013` (used as `theme_color` in the manifest and `<meta name="theme-color">`).
- Logo/icon files in `static/`: `icon.svg` (default favicon), `favicon.ico` (16/32/48), `apple-touch-icon.png` (180², opaque), `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`, `maskable_icon_x512.png` (PWA maskable). Icon masters (1024² transparent PNG, 3662² opaque PNG) live in the user's Google Drive, not in the repo. Title and meta/OG tags are static in `src/app.html`; no page-level `<svelte:head>` titles (a page title would override app.html — one was removed deliberately).
- PWA: `static/manifest.json`, linked from `app.html`. No service worker yet (caching/offline deliberately deferred).

**UI icons:** Material Symbols only, and always the **filled** variant. `.material-symbols-outlined` in `app.html` sets `font-variation-settings: 'FILL' 1` app-wide, so a bare `<span class="material-symbols-outlined">…</span>` already renders filled — never opt back into the outline style (no `'FILL' 0` overrides anywhere in `src/`). Font mechanics + how to regenerate the subset live in `.claude/rules/deployment.md` § UI fonts.

**Stack:** SvelteKit frontend (`src/routes/`), MapLibre GL JS (`src/routes/Map.svelte`), style generated from `scripts/config.yaml` → `scripts/generate_style.py` → `static/map-assets/style.json`. **Routing** via a forked local MOTIS v2 instance in `motis/` (fork sources in `motis/fork/`) plus a forked Valhalla router in `valhalla/` (fork sources in `valhalla/fork/`: Kora bicycle costing on pinned upstream, see `bicycle-costing-fork.md`) — Valhalla is the sole walking authority (transfer table from a precomputed matrix at import, live calls for query-time walks; no OSR walking fallback) — see `valhalla-pedestrian-router.md`, `transit-routing.md` for the engine + panel, and `route-display.md` for the on-map rendering. `scripts/routing/preprocess_osm_for_motis.py` adds `foot=yes` to CH `access=agricultural`/`forestry` ways so alp / forest roads route for pedestrians (CH-only PBF for MOTIS; `--valhalla` preset for the wide-bbox Valhalla input); the Valhalla preset also marks under-passing highways (`layer<0` or `cutting=*`, no tunnel/bridge) as `tunnel=yes` so their elevation is endpoint-interpolated instead of DEM-sampled — the DEM sees the structure above and would bake fake climbs into underpasses — and subtracts bus/PSV lanes from the `lanes` tags, since the bicycle costing's crossing penalty scales per lane and a bus lane doesn't make a crossing harder (`bicycle-costing-fork.md`). `scripts/routing/build_station_walk_network.py` synthesises the walkable surfaces Valhalla cannot derive itself, because it routes on ways and never on areas: a walk line down every mapped platform (welded into the pedestrian graph only across compatible levels), lift hubs, and direct crossings over pedestrian squares that bend around inner-ring obstacles rather than through them. It also anchors every GTFS quay onto its platform; see `station-walk-network.md`. `scripts/routing/preprocess_gtfs_for_motis.py` builds `data/gtfs_motis/` as a MOTIS-only sidecar with a platform-anchored `stops.txt` (rest of the GTFS hardlinked from `data/gtfs_routed/`), keeping the pipeline's map artifacts untouched — see `transit-routing.md` § Backend. `scripts/routing/build_valhalla_footpath_matrix.py` precomputes the stop-to-stop walking matrix the fork imports (`matrix_build_remote.md` for running it on a beefier machine).

**Key files:**
- `scripts/config.yaml` — all design tokens (colors, opacities, zoom levels, widths). Edit here, rerun generator, reload browser.
- `scripts/generate_style.py` — generates MapLibre style JSON from config. Thin driver; the layer-building code lives in the `scripts/style/` package.
- `static/map-assets/style.json` — generated output, gitignored, served at `/map-assets/style.json`. Alongside it live the `tl_*.pmtiles` tile bundles, referenced from the style as `pmtiles:///map-assets/tl_*.pmtiles`.

**Tile source:** OpenMapTiles schema (`openmaptiles` source, OpenFreeMap tiles).

**Basemap design language:**
- Color philosophy: green = nature (background, default), warm yellow/brown = urban human spaces, gray = dead/uninteresting (industry, motorways).
- Road hierarchy: motorway/trunk are "dead space" (gray, dashed when zoomed out, real-width fill when close); primary/secondary gray solid, not inviting; walkable streets carry the walkability color gradient (gray→yellow→orange); paths/cycleways are separate thin brown-orange lines from z14. Real-width streets from z15+ via meter-to-pixel conversion.
- Rendering constraints: `sprite: ""` (no sprite source — never use `icon-image`); fonts are Saira Regular/Bold/Italic/SemiBold/ExtraBold (DIN-inspired grotesque by Omnibus-Type, instantiated from the Google Fonts variable font), self-hosted as pre-built glyph PBFs under `static/map-assets/fonts/`. The color-dot indicator layer is the sole exception — it renders `●` (U+25CF) via `Noto Sans Regular`, which Saira lacks; that folder holds OpenFreeMap's pre-composited "Noto Sans Regular" PBFs (23-font composite that provides the black-circle glyph). Glyphs URL in `config.yaml` points at the local path, not an external server.

# Style Architecture

`generate_style.py` builds a MapLibre style JSON via discrete `build_*` functions called in this order in `generate_style()`:

1. `build_background_layer`
2. `build_hillshade_layer` — terrain relief, directly above background so it only shows through on bare land; below everything else
3. `build_landuse_layers`
4. `build_water_layers`
5. `build_building_layers`
6. `build_rail_layers(modes=["tunnel", "normal"])` — rail NOT on bridges
7. `build_road_layers(modes=["tunnel", "normal"])` — roads NOT on bridges
8. `build_path_layers(modes=["tunnel", "normal"])` — paths NOT on bridges
9. `build_bridge_deck_layer` — solid gray deck for all bridge transportation
10. `build_rail_layers(modes=["bridge"])` — rail ON bridges (above deck)
11. `build_road_layers(modes=["bridge"])` — roads ON bridges (above deck)
12. `build_path_layers(modes=["bridge"])` — paths ON bridges (above deck)
13. `build_border_layers`
14. `build_label_layers`

**Why this order:** Bridge deck must render between normal-mode and bridge-mode features so it appears above roads passing below the bridge but below roads on the bridge.

**Road class constants:**
- `MOTORWAY_CLASSES = ["motorway", "trunk"]`
- `MAIN_ROAD_CLASSES = ["primary", "secondary"]`
- `RAIL_CLASSES = ["rail", "transit"]`
- `FERRY_CLASSES = ["ferry"]`
- `WALKABLE_EXCLUDE = MOTORWAY_CLASSES + MAIN_ROAD_CLASSES + RAIL_CLASSES + FERRY_CLASSES`
- `PATH_CLASSES = ["path"]`

**Transit stop architecture:** All stop features (dots, pills, connectors) are `LineString` features in a single PMTile source (`tl_stop_pills.pmtiles`). Dots are `[pos, pos]` zero-length lines rendered as circles via `line-cap: round`. Layer paint order: dot-casing → connector-casing → pill-casing → dot-fill → pill-fill → connector-fill.

**View modes:** The map has two views, `standard` (place labels visible, all stop symbology hidden) and `transit-focus` (place labels hidden, stops visible), toggled client-side in `src/lib/Map.svelte` via layer visibility — one shared `style.json`, no regeneration. Transit lines render identically in both. See `view-modes.md`. Shipped default is `standard`; the code currently carries a `DEFAULT_VIEW` dev override to `transit-focus` during stop-rendering development.

**Terrain:** A `terrain` raster-DEM source (Mapterhorn free API, Terrarium-encoded WebP, tileSize 512, maxzoom 12) feeds two features (see `hillshade-and-contours.md`). Hillshade is always on, generated into the style (tokens under `terrain:` in `config.yaml`; the layer type has no opacity property, so `terrain.hillshade.opacity` is baked into the shadow/highlight colors as alpha). Contour lines are client-side only: `maplibre-contour` in `Map.svelte` builds them from the same DEM tiles, adaptive intervals from z9 (200/1000 m) tightening to z15+ (10/50 m), inserted below the transit block, off by default behind a toggle row in the menu panel (`MapMenu.svelte` § Layers). `maplibre-contour` ships a broken `exports` map, so `vite.config.ts` aliases it to its ESM bundle path, and its `DemSource` is constructed lazily because it spawns a Web Worker (crashes SSR at module scope).

# Transit Color Scheme

| Mode | Color | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Train (all rail) | red (hue 0) | one color for all types; speed shown via saturation/lightness |
| Tram | turquoise (hue 180) | |
| Metro | green (hue 120) | |
| City bus | blue (hue 220) | |
| Regional bus | bright orange (hue 25) | own s/l curve — stays vivid throughout; slow end light peach, max = pure bright orange |
| Ferry | blue (hue 220) | same hue as city bus |
| Mountain | purple (hue 290) | funicular, cable car, gondola (extended GTFS `route_type` 1300/1303/1400/116) plus rack-rail operators in the `mountain_agency_ids` whitelist (WAB, JB, GGB, RB, PB, BRB, MG, DFB, BOB-spb, VerAlp) — own s/l curve, deliberately narrow range centered on `#b340c9`. |

**Speed and frequency encoding:**
- Line thickness = frequency (higher freq = thicker) — `score_to_width_base(freq_score, mode)` over the per-mode `line_width` min/max bounds
- Color = speed (faster = darker + more saturated) — `speed_to_color(mode, speed_kmh)` over each mode's s/l curve

# Notable config.yaml Keys

These were added during basemap v1 (previously hardcoded in `generate_style.py`):
- `palette.rail` — rail line color (was hardcoded `#ffffff`)
- `palette.rail_opacity` — rail line opacity (was hardcoded `0.5`)
- `palette.bridge_deck_opacity` — opacity for the bridge deck shape
