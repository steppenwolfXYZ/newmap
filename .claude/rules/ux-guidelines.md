# UX / Design Guidelines

App-UI design language (SvelteKit side, `src/`). The map's own design
language lives in `project.md` § Basemap design language.

## Brand colors

Three brand colors, all defined as tokens in `src/variables.css` and
**always used via the variables**, never as literals:

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--gradient-brand` | kora green → kora brown, 135° | selected/active states, accents |
| `--brand` (red) | `#740013` | primary actions, hover emphasis |
| `--anthracite` | `#333` | dark fills, titles, dark chrome |

Supporting tokens: `--kora-green` / `--kora-brown` (the gradient
endpoints), `--gradient-brand-input` (165° variant), `--brand-hover`.

The splash screen in `app.html` duplicates the gradient values as
literals (it paints before any stylesheet loads) — keep them in sync
with `variables.css`.

## Usage rules

**Gradient** (always diagonal — 135°, or the 165° `--gradient-brand-input`
variant on thin wide elements where 135° would read as a flat
left-to-right fade):

- Selected/active states: segmented-toggle active segment, switch
  on-state, open menu disc, selected time row — always **white**
  text/icons on the gradient.
- Panel accents: 3px hairline along the top edge of floating panels
  (routing panel, menu panel), as a layered background so it follows
  the corner radius and never scrolls.
- Focus rings on text inputs (steep variant): permanent 2px transparent
  border + double background (`padding-box` fill, `border-box`
  gradient) so focusing never shifts layout.
- Selected connection card: 4px gradient strip on the left edge,
  painted *below* the selection border (the border is an `::after`
  overlay ring so it stays above the strip and all content).

**Brand red:**

- Primary action buttons (share primary, route button) — fill on
  hover/active, red glyph at rest for the route entry point.
- Hover color for icon buttons (see button system below) and for
  button-styled links. **Not** for normal text-link hovers — too much.
- Semantic accent (e.g. the "now" row in the time dropdown). No
  foreign accent colors (the old blue is gone).
- The routing panel's title icon: red circle, white glyph.

**Anthracite:**

- Panel/section titles (uppercase micro-titles).
- Keyboard-highlight rows in dropdowns (white text on anthracite) —
  highlight is hover-like, so it stays dark, not gradient.
- Dark fills like the loader track.

**Gray ramp:** everything else — list hovers, secondary buttons,
body text. List/row hovers stay gray, never gradient.

**Never:** red + gradient on the same element; kora green or kora
brown as standalone text/icon colors (tried, reverted — they only work
inside the gradient and the loader ball).

## Toggles (segmented controls)

No container border. Inactive segments `--gray-100` with dark text;
active segment gradient with white text. (View toggle, Leave-at /
Arrive-by.)

## Icon button system

`.icon-btn` in `app.css` § Shared patterns: backgroundless button that
gets a circular light-gray fill and a **brand-red** glyph on hover.
Used by all small utility buttons — × close/clear buttons, date
chevrons, swap, reset-to-now. Components add only sizing (padding,
font-size, margins) and must not re-set color/background, or the hover
state loses the cascade. Any new small icon button uses this class.

## Loader

The routing "searching" indicator (`RoutingPanel.svelte`): full-width
2.2rem pill, anthracite fill, 2px gradient border, ball swinging
side-to-side (1s alternate ease-in-out) fading kora green ↔ kora
brown. The border gradient is deliberately **horizontal** (the one
exception to the diagonal rule): the ball's color fade tracks its
x-position, so the border above/below the ball always matches the
ball's color.
