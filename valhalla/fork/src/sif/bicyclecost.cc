// kora fork: Kora-owned bicycle costing (bicycle-costing-fork.md).
//
// Full-file overlay of upstream src/sif/bicyclecost.cc at the VALHALLA_REF
// pinned in valhalla/fork/Dockerfile. The upstream file's request parsing,
// access checks, surface / speed / grade tables and test block are kept;
// the weighting model (EdgeCost + the two TransitionCost variants) is
// replaced by the three-tier quality model below. Every tunable lives in
// the `kora` namespace right under this header — nothing else in the file
// carries a magic number of its own. Everything kora-specific is marked
// with a "kora fork:" comment so a VALHALLA_REF bump can re-apply it onto
// the new upstream copy.
//
// Model in one paragraph: an edge's cost is its riding time multiplied by
// a tier factor — great (separated cycle infrastructure, slight bonus),
// fine (painted lanes, quiet streets, living streets: the plateau, all
// ≈ 1.0, so among fine options the shorter/faster one wins) or bad
// (through-traffic roads without infrastructure, multi-lane roads:
// significant penalty, calibrated so a real alternative wins but absurd
// detours do not) — plus the stock hill-avoidance term and the stock
// surface term. Official cycle routes (OSM relation membership, the
// graph's bike_network bit) earn a small multiplicative bonus. Stairs are
// priced steeply, uphill more than downhill, and `exclude_steps` removes
// them entirely. Edges that are walkable but not ridable in the travel
// direction — sidewalks, crossings, pedestrian zones, oneways against us —
// are traversable by pushing the bike at walking pace — honest time, free
// up to kPushFreeMeters, per-metre penalized beyond so only LONG pushes
// are discouraged; the fork's triplegbuilder overlay reports those
// sections as pedestrian-mode maneuvers so the client can draw them
// dotted. Transitions keep upstream's turn-time model and add the
// crossing rule: moving from one through-traffic road onto another costs
// extra unless it is a right turn; straight ahead it costs only across a
// traffic signal (the proxy for "a real crossing of two big roads").
//
// Request options: everything upstream accepts still parses. `use_roads`
// is accepted for compatibility but inert — the tier model replaces what
// it used to scale. New: `exclude_steps` (bool, default false).
