# Local routing backend bring-up (Valhalla + MOTIS fork).
# Run from the project root: ./scripts/routing/setup_routing.sh
#
# Turns a finished map pipeline run (./scripts/rebuild_transit.sh) into a
# working local routing stack. Every step is idempotent — re-running the
# script skips whatever is already in place, so it doubles as a repair /
# refresh tool after a pipeline rebuild.
#
# Steps:
#   1  Create docker network `koramaps`                 (instant; skipped if present)
#   2  Build the MOTIS + Valhalla fork images           (~30-60 min compile each; skipped if
#                                                        up to date with motis/fork, valhalla/fork)
#   3  Patch OSM PBFs + admin bounds + elevation        (~minutes each; skipped if up to date;
#                                                        first elevation build downloads ~min)
#   4  Start Valhalla (first run builds tiles)          (first run ~20-40 min, later instant)
#   5  Preprocess GTFS for MOTIS (platform snap)        (~1 min; always runs, cheap)
#   6  Build the Valhalla footpath matrix               (hours on a laptop; skipped when
#                                                        complete, resumes partial runs)
#   7  MOTIS import                                     (~10 min; skipped if index present)
#   8  Start MOTIS server + smoke test                  (seconds)
#
# Force flags (redo a step whose output already exists):
#
#   --force-image     rebuild the MOTIS and Valhalla fork docker images
#   --force-osm       re-patch both preprocessed OSM PBFs
#   --force-elevation regenerate the Mapterhorn elevation cells
#   --force-matrix    delete matrix CSV + checkpoint, recompute from scratch
#   --force-import    re-run the MOTIS import
#
# Step selection (for orchestrators that overlap this script's phases
# with the map pipeline — see scripts/update_map.sh):
#
#   --steps 1,2,3,4   run only the listed steps, in order, skip the rest.
#                     Prerequisite checks still run. Default: all 1-8.

# Sizing knobs (env): VALHALLA_THREADS (Valhalla serving pool; Linux
# defaults to nproc, elsewhere 8) and MATRIX_WORKERS (builder-side
# concurrency; defaults to VALHALLA_THREADS + 4 when unset).
#
# Prerequisites: ./scripts/rebuild_transit.sh has run at least once
# (needs data/gtfs_routed/ and the step-02 OSM downloads), docker is
# running, and the pyosmium package is installed
# (python3 -m pip install --user --break-system-packages osmium).
